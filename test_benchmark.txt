Hello, World! Hello again! Hello once more!
This is a test file for benchmarking the GPU text search engine.
We need some patterns to search for: 
- Single character: a, e, o
- Short words: the, and, for
- Longer patterns: Hello, World, engine
- Complex patterns: gpu-text-search, benchmarking
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Pattern matching is fundamental to text processing.
This file contains multiple instances of the word "the" and "Hello".
Performance testing requires consistent, repeatable results.
Throughput measurements should be in the range of GB/s for large files.
