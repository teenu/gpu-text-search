## Version 2.0.0 - "Gilded Edition" (December 6, 2024)

### Major Performance Optimizations

#### **Cold Start Performance Revolution**
- **Issue Identified**: First search 16x slower than subsequent searches
- **Root Cause**: Runtime shader compilation and buffer allocation overhead
- **Solution**: Metal Binary Archives + Persistent Buffer Pools
- **Result**: Cold start improved from 1.63s → 0.10s (16x faster)

#### **Metal Binary Archives Implementation**
- Added `MTLBinaryArchive` support for Pipeline State Object (PSO) caching
- Eliminates runtime shader compilation completely
- Automatic cache persistence for subsequent app launches
- 100ms+ compilation time reduced to <1ms pipeline creation

#### **Persistent Buffer Pool System**
- Pre-allocated GPU buffers during initialization
- Zero allocation overhead for repeated searches
- Smart buffer reuse with Apple Silicon unified memory optimization
- Eliminated 10-50ms allocation overhead per search

#### **Pattern Buffer Caching**
- Intelligent LRU cache for up to 32 recent patterns
- Zero allocation overhead for repeated pattern searches
- Smart cache management with automatic cleanup
- UTF-8 conversion caching for frequently used patterns

### Code Quality & Efficiency Improvements

#### **Code Cleanup & Optimization**
- **Lines Reduced**: 806 → 720 lines (11% reduction)
- **Duplication Eliminated**: Removed embedded kernel source redundancy
- **API Consolidation**: Single `optimalStorageMode()` function
- **Error Handling**: Removed unused error cases, streamlined validation

#### **Memory Management Enhancements**
- Apple Silicon unified memory architecture fully leveraged
- Intelligent storage mode selection (.storageModeShared vs .storageModeManaged)
- Buffer lifecycle optimization with persistent pools
- Reduced memory fragmentation through smart reuse

#### **Warmup System Simplification**
- Reduced warmup complexity from 64 lines to 4 lines (94% reduction)
- Binary archives make extensive warmup largely unnecessary
- Focused warmup on buffer preparation only
- Maintained user control with --warmup flag

### Critical Bug Fixes

#### **File Size Integer Overflow**
- **Issue**: Files >2GB displayed negative byte counts
- **Cause**: 32-bit integer overflow in `formatFileSize()`
- **Fix**: Changed from `%d` to `%lld` format specifier with Int64 casting
- **Impact**: Proper display of file sizes up to exabytes

### Performance Metrics

#### **Throughput Improvements**
- **Peak Performance**: 32.3 GB/s → 32.5 GB/s
- **Cold Start**: 1,820 MB/s → 28,627 MB/s (15.7x improvement)
- **Consistency**: 0.138s std dev → 0.006s std dev (23x more reliable)
- **Memory Efficiency**: Zero allocations for cached patterns

#### **Real-World Performance**
- **3.1GB File Search**: 733,756 GATTACA matches in 0.099s
- **Maintained Accuracy**: 100% cross-validation with grep
- **Reduced Variance**: Eliminated 16x performance difference between runs
